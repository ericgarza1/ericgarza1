Hi I'm Eric! ðŸ‘‹
I am a breakfast taco enthusiast who enjoys finding and creating my own problems to solve then sharing those solved problems on here. I am currently studying for my CCNA and pursuing my Bachelor's in Network & Cloud Architecture.   

Outside the world of tech I enjoy lifting and playing drums.
